<h1>Science on Side</h1>
<h3>The Joy of Doing Science While Keeping Your Day Job</h3>

<div>

<p>You don’t have to be affiliated with a university or a research lab to do science. You don’t even have to have a PhD degree. Many great discoveries in the past and recent times have come about by people like you and me who are not part of the “inner circle” of academia. Galileo, Darwin, Faraday, Benjamin Franklin, and George Mendel never had a science degree. And yet they are remembered as great scientists.</p>



<p>I always wanted to be a scientist. I was that kid who everyone hated in class because I’d ask a thousand questions. I wanted a science degree but ended up with an engineering degree because, in India during my teens, an engineering degree was in vogue because it guaranteed a job in an IT services company. Very quickly I realized that the tried and tested “safe” career path was not for me, and so I spent almost all my time trying my hands at doing something completely new.  I started a couple of startups in my college days and that path eventually led me to Wingify (my current startup). In parallel, I managed to get <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=paras+chopra+%22delhi+college+of+engineering%22&amp;btnG=&amp;oq=paras+">a couple of research papers</a> out* as <em>an undergraduate student</em>, with <em><em><a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/in-silico-biology/isb00253">on*e</a></em> without any professor as an author.</em></p>
<p>My intention of highlighting this personal story isn’t to brag. If anything, the journals where my papers got published are obscure and probably had a very low threshold for acceptance. But they were peer-reviewed, and it felt great to have done science-like things which were novel enough for other scientists to have accepted as science. My papers aren’t blockbuster, but at least they’re getting cited by other researchers and giving me the joy of being (a small) part of the grand narrative of science.</p>
<p>After almost a decade of growing my startup, I want to rekindle my interest in doing science and share that passion with others. So I’m putting together this manifesto to inspire and guide others on how they can do science while keeping their main job.</p>


<h3><a id="1_Yes_you_can_do_science_on_the_side_12"></a>#1 Yes, you can do science on the side</h3>

<p>The biggest hurdle in doing science as an independent researcher is funding yourself. Professors, postdocs, and graduate students are paid to do science. It’s their full-time job. But probably that path isn’t for you. There could be any number of reasons why you don’t want to do science full time. Probably you are successful in your career and don’t want to quit it altogether, or probably you know that full-time science will make spend most of your time writing grant applications, or probably you don’t want to get involved in the bureaucracy of academia.</p>
<p>Even if you’re not part of traditional academia or research labs, it is possible to do science by yourself and publish your findings in respectable journals. If you had a lot of money or time, you’d probably spend all your day chasing butterflies of curiosity. However, I know you probably have a job, or a family or both. And it’s okay to not quit everything to do science.</p>
<p>If other people can keep a job and paint, compose music, write novels on the side, you can do science on the side too.</p>
<h3><a id="2_Pick_an_area_which_you_can_keep_reading_about_day_and_night_20"></a>#2 Pick an area which you can keep reading about day and night</h3>





<p>As a side scientist, you’ll have limited hours in a week to spend on your reading and research. The last thing you want to do is to pick an area where you have to drag yourself to get anything done. Remember, this is NOT your main job. You’re doing this for joy and any field - no matter how obscure and unpopular - is OK as long as it’s attractive to <em>you</em>.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure what you love, simply recall which books and articles do you naturally gravitate towards. Let your past emotional self-guide you. Do you pick books on culture? Or, World War I? Or perhaps you’re obsessed with design patterns? Maybe, evolution is your thing.</p>
<p>It’s also OK not obsess with getting your choice of research right in the first go. There’s no exam. Keep exploring until you find an topic you can’t stop thinking about. It may take years, or it may never happen. But in the pursuit of that, you’ll end up learning a lot.</p>
<h3><a id="3_You_dont_want_to_be_a_crank_Learn_the_basics_first_28"></a>#3 You don’t want to be a crank. Learn the basics first</h3>
<p>Everyone has a pet theory about something that they think is novel. You probably have many such pet theories. I bet that Nobel Prize winners get pitched by random strangers all the time about how so-and-so can be solved if the problem is approached in the suggested manner. I’m guilty of this. When I was in high school, I wrote a letter to Stephen Hawking proposing a mechanism for universe’s expansion (which my 10-year-old brain thought happens because something outside the universe attracts universe via gravitational forces). Professor Hawking never replied to my letter.</p>
<p>Science is about discovering novel and true knowledge. As a side scientist, you’ll be competing with full-time scientists who spend their working days figuring out different ideas, methods and approaches. Yes, you may have brilliant ideas but if you’re not rigorous about those ideas, you may end up with half-baked conclusions rather than strong claims. And nobody will take you seriously if you do your science sloppily.</p>
<p>There’s a reason why graduate students spend a couple of semesters doing courses before starting with their research. These courses provide them with tools without which they can’t even articulate problems, let alone find solutions. Think about it in this way - via online courses or textbooks, you have on your disposal so many ways to approach problems in your area. So, why <em>wouldn’t</em> you want to get familiar with all such tools?</p>
<p>Doing online courses is also a great way to get exposed to unsolved problems and meet fellow side scientists who you can collaborate with.</p>
<h3><a id="4_Do_a_warm_up_Attack_small_problems_first_38"></a>#4 Do a warm up. Attack small problems first</h3>
<p>It would be wonderful to shoot for Nobel prize worthy research, but it’s probably not a good idea. Big discoveries (and awards associated with them) depend significantly on chance. Moreover, the stronger the opponent you’re against, the harder it is to hit a home run. And as a side scientist, you’re against the biggies in your field. You’re against researchers who have spent decades in your area. Chances that you get an insight that they missed is non-zero but tiny.</p>
<p>Chasing breakthroughs in science requires an obsession which only develops over time. If you aim big in the first go, what is more likely: you try for a long time, get frustrated and lose interest OR that you discover a breakthrough. Research is tough and by definition, successful outcomes are an unknown. As a side scientist, more than anything you need the motivation to keep going after you come home, drained from your job.  Wins have a compounding effect on motivation and you want to set yourself for multiple tiny wins rather than one big win.</p>
<p>So rather than looking for big unsolved problems, look for tiny problems that you think you can solve, given your skill set and background. No problem is small if you’re doing it for yourself. One good way to warm up is to simply try to replicate results by other scientists and try to do something new just a tiny little bit.  Once you start adding your ideas to existing results, you can make incremental leaps and do more of your original research.</p>
<p>Remember - tiny wins compound. Focus on solving small problems in your area first.</p>
<h3><a id="5_Make_full_use_of_public_datasets_and_your_programming_chops_48"></a>#5 Make full use of public datasets and your programming chops</h3>
<p>I’m biased towards computational science because I’m a programmer but a side scientist can progress faster if s/he has the same resources as a full-time researcher in a lab has. You’d be at a significant disadvantage if your type of science requires conducting experiments using expensive machines.</p>
<p>These days there are tons of publicly available datasets released by government agencies and research labs. And also don’t forget the Internet. If there’s no ready set, you can always build your own data set by scraping websites or by conducting surveys among a specific set of people on the Internet. This luxury where anyone can gather data of almost any sort so cheaply was unheard of until recently. Make full use of it.</p>
<p>Also, remember that programming is nothing but telling the computer to do work for you in precisely the manner that you desire. So as a side scientist, it’d do you well to learn programming and delegate much of the grunt work to a computer while you focus on the juicy parts of the problem.</p>
<h3><a id="6_When_youre_ready_search_for_ignored_problems_56"></a>#6 When you’re ready, search for ignored problems</h3>
<p>Curiously there are many problems that scientists in academia will ignore because it’s unlikely to get them a paper in a journal they care about. But these restrictions don’t apply to you. What you want to do is original science, irrespective of whether it’s <em>Nature</em>-worthy or not. (Isn’t that right?)</p>
<p>Your chances of coming up with something original is highest if you pursue an area that’s ignored by other researchers. Getting good results in science is like getting success in business. You do not enter a competitive market and expect to make a killing. You enter a market where you’re unique in what you serve and so all customers flock to you and not your competitors.</p>
<p>Similarly, make results flock to you by being the only one or among the few ones to focus on a particular angle. A few tips on what’s usually ignored: problems unique to your local area, died “fads” and “trends” in your chosen area (they usually come back!), and cross-disciplinary approaches (apply a new method/approach that’s virtually unknown in your field).</p>
<h3><a id="7_Dont_do_it_alone_Find_collaborators_64"></a>#7 Don’t do it alone. Find collaborators</h3>
<p>No matter how self-motivated you are, in your low days, you need someone to give you a push. You need someone to brainstorm with. You need someone to share the same passion for the specific problem as you do. Just like a startup is more likely to succeed with more than one founder, a research problem is more likely to get solved if there’s a group working on it.</p>
<p>Now, where do you find collaborators? As I mentioned earlier, online courses and forums are a great way to find them. Or, you can email a professor with your research proposal, asking for guidance. Two of my three papers in undergraduate days were co-authored by a professor whom I had never met. I had cold emailed him and he agreed to help me. (In my experience, professors are extremely nice and are very much willing to help. It also doesn’t hurt them to get one more paper with their name on).</p>
<h3><a id="8_Dont_hoard_your_ideas_Share_them_freely_70"></a>#8 Don’t hoard your ideas. Share them freely</h3>
<p>It’s natural to have reservations about involving strangers in your research. There’s the risk of someone “stealing” your idea, or there’s the risk of someone getting more credit than they “deserve”. Both of these fears are unfounded.</p>
<p>People today are bombarded with information, and they have their life to live. When you share your idea with someone else, it’s unlikely that they’ll pay it as much attention as you’ve been doing. Even if they do, it’s even more unlikely that they’ll drop everything that they’ve been doing and pursue your idea instead. Theft of ideas only happens when there is a motivated thief. It doesn’t happen when you are to approach for feedback while the “supposed” thief is busy answering emails. As they say, if an idea is good, you’d have to ram it down people’s throats. So share your ideas liberally. Maximize information acquisition through other people’s opinion. The slim risk of someone running away with your Nobel prize is slim.</p>
<p>When it comes to someone else sharing disproportionately large credit when their contribution was tiny, know that it’s your ego speaking. The real joy is in the process. The outcome lasts for just a tiny bit and it’s OK if that outcome is not completely fair. The upside of having smart people around you is much more than the potential risk of sharing the podium with someone else.</p>
<h3><a id="9_Shoot_for_peer_reviewed_journals_but_its_OK_to_publish_on_your_blog_78"></a>#9 Shoot for peer reviewed journals, but it’s OK to publish on your blog</h3>
<p>Peer review journals are great because they force you to be rigorous in your approach and novel in your findings. Aiming for publish-worthy research is good because you’ll subject yourself to the same standards for yourself that all other scientists do.</p>
<p>If you’ve never published before, the effort that goes into the preparation of draft manuscript will seem daunting. Journals usually are quite specific about what sections do they want in a paper, how should it be typeset and what level of originality do they expect. After submission, it may take months to even get a response from them. All this effort, however, is worth it because every rejection makes your research better. In the peer review process, you get feedback from the top experts in the field, essentially free of cost. Why wouldn’t you aim for such rejections?</p>
<p>However, every human has a breakdown point. Whenever you want to give up on a problem, the least you can do is to make a dump of your results with notes on your blog. Record your effort for posterity. However, since your findings haven’t gotten peer acceptance, ensure that you detail how anyone else can replicate your research findings. Who knows: perhaps someone else may pick from where you left.</p>
<h3><a id="10_Never_stop_marketing_your_findings_86"></a>#10 Never stop “marketing” your findings</h3>
<p>Most research findings are read by very people. PhD thesis are usually not read by anyone else other than the PhD student and his/her advisor. As a side scientist, the chances that anyone will come across your research is even more slim.</p>
<p>If you care about people noticing and making use of what you’ve found, you need to treat your research as your startup. Tweet about it. Make a video on it. Give talks in conferences. Develop interactive tools. Pitch to journalists. Remember that a research paper is one - albeit a formal - way of communicating your ideas and findings. You should make full use of your inner marketer to shamelessly promote your research wherever you can.</p>
<p>(If you think you don’t care about other people noticing, try ignoring a genuine compliment. As a human, you’re prone to work harder to develop whatever got you that compliment - be it your looks, intellect, or scientific acumen. Make use of seeking genuine appreciation of your work as a hack to derive more meaning-juice out of your future work).</p>
